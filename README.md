   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bassem-krayem/motamyezon_for_text_books.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd motamyezon_for_text_books
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   - Use npm to install all necessary packages listed in `package.json`:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**

   1. **Open PostgreSQL**:

      - Start by opening the PostgreSQL interactive terminal:

      ```bash
      psql -U your_username -d postgres
      ```

   2. **Create the Database**:

      - Create a new database named `motamyezon`:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE motamyezon;
      ```

      - Then, switch to the created database

      ```sql
      \c motamyezon
      ```

   3. **Create the Tables**:

      - Use the provided SQL script to create the necessary tables. Run the following command in the terminal to pipe the `create_table.sql` script into PostgreSQL:

      ```bash
      cat sql_scripts/create_tables.sql | psql -U your_username -d motamyezon
      ```

   4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

      - In the root of the project, create a `.env` file after installing dependencies.
      - Replace the placeholders below with your own PostgreSQL credentials (such as `PG_USER` and `PG_PASSWORD`), and add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

      ```plaintext
      PG_USER=your_postgresql_username
      PG_HOST="localhost"
      PG_DATABASE=motamyezon
      PG_PASSWORD=your_postgresql_password
      PG_PORT=5432

      ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
